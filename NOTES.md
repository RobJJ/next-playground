# NOTES

### Head title information

This info is stored with:
export const metadata = {
title: "{input name here}",
};

### OLD FETCHING METHODS

Previous Next.js data fetching methods such as getServerSideProps, getStaticProps, and getInitialProps are not supported in the new App Router. However, you can still use them in the Pages Router.
